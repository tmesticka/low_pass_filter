# low_pass_filter

Proposal
The created package aims to contain code that would based on user's input - a time-series dataset, filter out the high-frequency noise. This is why I am calling it a low-pass filter. It will convert data to the frequency domain using fast fourier transform. Then it will apply the low pass filter, and the package will also contain a function that is going to plot both, the original and filtered sample and compare them in a graph. 
For this package to work the user needs to install two already existant packages, numpy and matplotlib. this can be done easily with the command pip install numpy matplotlib.
