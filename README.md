    Project Overview: 
The Low-pass filter package is designed to assist its users in removing high-frequency noise from time-series data. These kind of filters are essential in signal processing given they only allow frequencies bellow the cutoff frequency, making the signal easier to interpret and work with. This package makes this process of multiple advanced steps less time consuming and much easier. 

    Main concepts and methods used:
1) Low-pass filtering
2) Data visualization

    Libraries and dependencies:
